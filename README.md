# Tell Request

Guide reviewers through your pull requests.

## What is a tell request?

A Tell Request is a collection of comments and visual cues applied to a pull request, presented in a suggested viewing order. You are asking someone to let you tell them about your changes before they pull.

In a traditional pull request, you are presented with a set of file diffs and perhaps a comment explaining them, but it is left to the reader to figure out how to navigate between them.

## Why is a tell request?

When you open a pull request, you are asking the reviwer for their time and concentration. The philosophy of a Tell Request is that as the requestor it is up to you to put the effort in making the process as smooth as possible.

There a lots of ways of doing this:
* Adding a good summary comment to the pull request
* Adding your own expository comments at specific places in the pull request
* Having logical, progressive, digestable commits (and commit messages)
* Limiting the amount of overall changes
* Limiting the scope and complexity of the overall changes
* Linking to relevant documentation / requirements / context
* Presenting the changes in an in-person

These are all useful tools that hopefully you already use. A Tell Request is one more tool that has elements of some of the others.
